# Hotel Management System

## Overview
This project is a hotel management system built with Laravel that provides API support for managing hotel operations such as user registration, login, role management (with one role per user), reservations, rooms, customers, and conflict prevention in bookings.

## Features
- **User Registration & Login:** API endpoints for user registration and authentication.
- **Role Management (One Role Per User):** Each user is assigned only one role, simplifying role-based access control based on the userâ€™s assigned role.
- **Room Management:** Create, update, and delete room records, with detailed information about room.
- **Customer Management:** Manage customer details including contact information.
- **Reservation System:** Add and manage room reservations, including the ability to check room availability and prevent overlapping bookings.
- **Conflict Prevention:** A built-in mechanism to check room availability before confirming a reservation, preventing double bookings.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Laravel 11
- **Database:** Sqlite
- **Authentication:** Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control using Laravel's built-in Authorization and Policies
- **Conflict Prevention:** Custom logic to prevent overlapping reservations
